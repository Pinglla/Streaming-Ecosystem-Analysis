# Streaming-Ecosystem-Analysis

[Project PowerPoint](Streaming_Ecosystem_Analysis.pdf)

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the streaming platform ecosystem and identify opportunities for TV studios to create content that succeeds in the streaming space. By understanding content demand and market trends, this analysis provides valuable insights for content creators in determining the most promising genres and show types to develop. Rather than relying on viewer reviews to measure a show's performance, this project takes a data-driven approach, focusing on content acquisition trends, market gaps, and key success factors for streaming platforms. Specifically, we utilize the ReelGood score to assess content performance and strategic positioning. By addressing these critical questions, we aim to provide actionable recommendations that empower studios to make informed content development decisions.

## Data Source

The dataset for this project was provided by Professor Milan Miric, an Associate Professor of Data Science at USC. It contains 287,835 records, including seven numerical fields and 11 categorical fields. Each record provides detailed information about a show, such as genre, release year, duration, type, streaming service, ReelGood score, IMDb score, and relevant tags, among other attributes. This rich dataset enables a comprehensive analysis of content trends and performance across streaming platforms.

## Tools

- Python – Used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- PowerPoint – Used for creating reports and presenting findings.

## Data Cleaning

During the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Handling Missing Values – Some records contained missing values, which could impact the accuracy of our analysis. We addressed these gaps to ensure data integrity.
2. Filtering Data – Given the large number of streaming platforms in the dataset, we focused on major platforms—Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max—to provide more relevant and actionable insights.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

This project aims to answer three fundamental questions about the streaming content landscape:

- Content Demand – What type of content is sought after by streaming platforms? / What type of content are they likely to acquire / offer?
- Market Gaps – What type of content is not currently being offered? Is there a potential gap?
- Success Factors – Which TV shows are successful in the streaming space?

## Findings

1. Prioritize High-Demand Genres – TV studios should focus on producing content within the top five most popular genres: Drama, Comedy, Action & Adventure, Documentary, and Thriller. Additionally, an analysis of exclusive streaming content reveals that Romance replaces Thriller in exclusivity, suggesting an opportunity for studios to invest more resources in Romance-themed content. Exploring the top five associated tags for each genre can further guide storytelling strategies.
2. Capitalize on Underserved High-Scoring Genres – Our analysis identified Cult, Anime, and LGBTQ-themed content as highly rated on ReelGood but underrepresented on TV and in movies. Creating more content in these genres presents an opportunity to attract niche yet engaged audiences.
3. Leverage Insights from Top-Performing Shows – By analyzing multiple success metrics, we identified the top 10 highest-performing TV shows in the streaming space. These shows can serve as a benchmark for studios to understand key success factors and develop content with similar attributes.

## Limitations

When selecting the five major streaming platforms for analysis, further research is needed to ensure the chosen platforms align with the interests of TV studios rather than viewers alone. Key factors such as platform reputation, subscription fees, monetization strategies, and recommendation algorithms should be considered to provide a more comprehensive and strategic selection for content creators.
